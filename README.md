# homebrew-tap

Contents for the Homebrew tap repository. Copy this directory to a **new public repo
named exactly `Sidewalk-Developer-Group/homebrew-tap`** — Homebrew derives the repo name
from the tap name, so the `homebrew-` prefix is not optional.

```
homebrew-tap/
├── README.md
└── Casks/
    └── deployer-cli.rb  ← written and bumped by goreleaser on every tagged release
```

`Casks/deployer-cli.rb` does not need to be hand-authored: the first `goreleaser release`
run in `deployer-cli` creates it, and every later release commits an updated version and
checksums.

## Once published

```sh
brew install sidewalk-developer-group/tap/deployer-cli
```

The cask is `deployer-cli`, not `deployer`: homebrew-core already ships a `deployer`
formula (PHP Deployer, deployer.org), and sharing the name would make
`brew install deployer` resolve to core's — a different tool. The **binary** installed is
still `deployer`; core's is `dep`, so nothing collides on `PATH`.

The two-step form is equivalent:

```sh
brew tap sidewalk-developer-group/tap
brew install deployer-cli
```

`brew install sidewalk-developer-group/tap` on its own is **not** valid — that names the
tap, not a cask.

## Prerequisites for the release pipeline

In `Sidewalk-Developer-Group/deployer-cli`, add an Actions secret `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`:
a fine-grained PAT with **Contents: read and write** on `homebrew-tap` only. The default
`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to another repository, so without it the release succeeds but
the cask is never bumped.
